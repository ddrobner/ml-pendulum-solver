# this is a script to numerically solve ODES and then save that data
# we'll attempt to create a model which estimates period from the length of the pendulum
# the bit that is interesting is that the ODE is nonlinear so there is no analytic solution to the ODE
# of course, there are plenty of numerical ODE solvers out there which can do this easily but this is mainly just to do something cool with tensorflow
